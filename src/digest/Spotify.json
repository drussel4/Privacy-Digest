This is also known as interest based advertising, targeted advertising, or 'sharing' for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.\nAn example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.\nHow to control tailored advertising:\nYou can control tailored advertising in your account Privacy Settings under 'Tailored Ads'.\nIf you do not have an account or are not logged in, you can also opt-out by clicking the 'Your Privacy Choices' link at the footer of our website\nYou can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it.

This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts).

See the section on 'Deletion' in Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.\nYou can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.\nData that expires after a specific period of time\nWe have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.\nData retained until your Spotify account is deleted\nWe keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.\nData retained for extended time periods for limited purposes\nAfter your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:\nto help ensure user safety, or\nto protect against harmful content on our platform.\nThis helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.\n7. Transfer to other countries\nBecause of the global nature of our business, Spotify transfers personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy.\nWhenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law.\nWe also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:\ntechnical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization\npolicies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests\n8. Keeping your personal data safe\nWe're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.\nTo protect your user account, we encourage you to:\nuse a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account\nnever share your password with anyone\nlimit access to your computer and browser\nlog out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device\nread more detail on protecting your account\nYou can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.\nIf other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.\nIt's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download.\n9. Children\nNote: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.\nThe Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:\nis under the age of 13 years\nmakes it illegal to process their personal data, or\nrequires parental consent to process their personal data\nWe do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.\nIf you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.\nIf we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.\nWhen using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.\n10. Changes to this Policy\nWe may occasionally make changes to this Policy.\nWhen we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.\n11.
